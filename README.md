# Pong game

I made this little project to pratice the language and some concept of game programmation.

The game is made with lua and love2d game engine.

There is no screen menu in this version just the game with no endgame.

You download the repository and play the game via the pongGame.exe in the folder executable.

cmd : 
- Player 1(left side) : up -> Z | down -> S
- Player 2(right side) : up -> arrow_up | down -> arrow_down
